## I want to report a bug or a problem about this project

[**Make an issue**](https://github.com/TheVanadium/pokemon-to-scale/issues/new). Before creating an issue, make sure that:

1. You list the steps to reproduce the problem to show that other users may experience it as well, if the issue is not self-descriptive.
2. Search to make sure it isn't a duplicate. [The advanced search syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) may come in handy.
3. It is not a trivial problem or demands unrealistic dev time to fix. Such issues may be closed.

If there's a feature you'd like to see added to the project, feel free to [make an issue](https://github.com/TheVanadium/pokemon-to-scale/issues/new) with a clear and concise explanation of what should be added.
